# Battery Degradation (Electrochemical Modelling)
Exploring electrochemical lithium-ion battery degradation modelling.

## It's Final Charge
At the end of August 2020 my OG Pixel of 3 years stopped turning on. I became curious in understanding what was happening to the battery that final lead to the retirement of one of my favourite phones. I began looking into battery simulation textbooks, videos and papers (all will be referenced below). Common mathamatical models include equivalent circuit modeling (ECM), black-box modeling and fundamental governing equations. I plan to first focus on a blend of empirical data and fundamental governing equations (electrochemical models) by using [this paper](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/document/7488267/authors#authors) as a starting point and then seeing where this research dive will take me next.

## Empirical Data
I am still looking for a opensource battery database that is more current. The battery data I'll be using for now is from the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE) [testbed](https://c3.nasa.gov/dashlink/resources/133/). The README document with this data is under battery-data-README.txt.
